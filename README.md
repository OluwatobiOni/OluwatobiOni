## Hi!👋, I’m Oluwatobi Oni, but you can call me Tobi

### I am a Health Data Scientist
- 👔 I currently work as an Information Analyst with Public Health Scotland
- 👀 Fun fact: I was a pharmacist before I switched career into data
- 🤝 I would love to collaborate on data science and AI projects that improve healthcare
- 👩‍💻 I use R, Python, SQL, Excel, and PowerBI
- 😉 I love dogs, all shades of blue, and superheroes (Superman is my favourite)

## Feel free to look at some of my work here, and reach out to me if you'd love to work together on something. Cheers!
